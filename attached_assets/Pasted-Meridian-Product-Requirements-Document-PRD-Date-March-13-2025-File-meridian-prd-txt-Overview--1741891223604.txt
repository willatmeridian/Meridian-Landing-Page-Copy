File: meridian_prd.txt

Overview
- This PRD outlines the requirements for "Meridian," a landing page designed to showcase Viridian's outsourced procurement services for business customers.

1. Objective
- Goal: Showcase Viridian's outsourced procurement service, emphasizing cost savings and reliability for business customers.
- Focus: Highlight how the service reduces procurement costs and ensures dependable supply chains.

2. Features
2.1 Affiliate Network Section
- Purpose: Highlight Viridian’s network of 2900 pallet companies and cardboard services.
- Visual: Include a U.S. map showing geographic reach of the affiliate network.
- Key Message: Emphasize cost savings achieved by leveraging group spend across key markets.
- Content: Brief text (e.g., "Tap into our network of 2900+ partners for unbeatable pricing and reliability").

2.2 How It Works Section
- Purpose: Explain the procurement process in three clear steps.
- Steps:
  - Step 1: Scout vendors near the customer’s location for optimal proximity and pricing.
  - Step 2: Secure backup vendors for emergencies (e.g., tornadoes disrupting a pallet vendor).
  - Step 3: Negotiate vendor bids to align with customer payment terms.
- Design Suggestion: Use a simple 3-step flow graphic or bullet points for clarity.

2.3 Interactive Demo
- Purpose: Provide a mock portal to simulate the procurement experience (not fully functional).
- Content:
  - Display sample materials (e.g., pallets).
  - Show summaries of historical buying patterns (e.g., "Last 6 months: 500 pallets purchased").
  - Include clickable options: "Buy Pallets" and "Request Trailer Swaps" (for cardboard or pallets).
- Interactivity: Clicking options triggers fake alerts or pop-ups (e.g., "Order submitted!" or "Swap request sent!").
- Design: Dashboard-like layout with a clean, professional feel.

3. Tech Notes (For Replit Development)
3.1 HTML
- Structure:
  - Section 1: Affiliate Network (with placeholder for U.S. map).
  - Section 2: How It Works (3-step process).
  - Section 3: Interactive Demo (mock portal layout).
- Use semantic HTML (e.g., <section>, <header>, <main>) for clarity.

3.2 CSS
- Styling Goals:
  - Clean, professional look with a modern aesthetic.
  - U.S. map placeholder: Styled as a rectangular box (e.g., 600px x 400px) with a "Map Coming Soon" label.
  - Demo: Dashboard-like feel with borders, padding, and hover effects on buttons.
- Suggested Colors: Neutral palette (e.g., white, gray, blue accents).

3.3 JavaScript
- Interactivity for Demo:
  - Add event listeners to "Buy Pallets" and "Request Trailer Swaps" buttons.
  - Trigger fake responses (e.g., alert("Order submitted!") or alert("Swap request sent!")).
- Keep it simple: No backend or persistent state required.

Development Guidelines
- Target: Build a functional prototype in a 90-minute development session.
- Focus: Prioritize layout and interactivity over complex animations or backend logic.
- Deliverable: A single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, uploadable to Replit.
