Problem Statement:
The pallet and packaging industry in the United States is highly fragmented, with over 2,300 independent pallet companies and countless packaging suppliers, each offering different levels of service, pricing, and quality. Businesses face the daunting task of sourcing and managing suppliers across various regions. The complexity grows for companies with multi-location operations, making it nearly impossible to consistently ensure competitive pricing, reliable service, and streamlined procurement processes.
For businesses managing procurement at the site level, inefficiencies arise from outdated supplier relationships, inconsistent quality, and missed opportunities for cost savings. Many are left exposed to market fluctuations—such as the 80% drop in pallet prices during 2022/23—due to a lack of real-time market insight.
In centralized supply chains, the complexities of managing pallet and packaging decisions across multiple suppliers can result in:
Over-engineered quality driving up costs by as much as 50%.
Difficulty in sourcing from key local market players.
Multiple suppliers and invoicing processes, adding to administrative burdens.
Limited understanding of market trends across different metropolitan regions.
Delayed response to price fluctuations, reducing competitive advantage.
This fragmentation leads to operational inefficiencies, increased costs, and a reactive, rather than proactive, procurement strategy.
